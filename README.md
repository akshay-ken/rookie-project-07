## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Challenges

> Problem: i was unable to use both rounded-2xl and rounded-tr-full tailwind class

- **solution**:- i checked computed values in my dev tool for that element and it showed both values are applied the issue is 2xl value is really small and full value is really big in e so i used custom rem value for it and it solved my issue;

> problem: i wondered to use label or span tag for range type input

- **solution**:- but then decide for accessibility i will use labels along with my range input and put them in flex-box.

> problem: created box with absolute and relative positioning but now wanted to add tail on desktop view using tailwindcss.

- **solution** : i was able to shift position of box on desktop and mobile view but having trouble creating its tail so i asked ai to just write simple triangle using div tag and it gave me bare minimum structure which i modified latter and made it look like speech buble as whole.
